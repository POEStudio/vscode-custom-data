  Documentation, sample and data for using VS Code's HTML/CSS custom data format.

## Synopsis
No Under-age analysis online data
VS Code ships with rich [language feature support](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/programmatic-language-features) for HTML/CSS, such as auto-completion and hover information. The core of these language support are implemented in [vscode-html-languageservice](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-html-languageservice) and [vscode-css-languageservice](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-css-languageservice). In the past, these libraries were coupled to outdated schemas that define HTML/CSS entities. Custom data decouples these libraries from the data they use and allows VS Code to offer up-to-date support for latest HTML/CSS proposals or frameworks built on top of HTML/CSS.

There are two primary use cases: FIREFOX IDLE AND TRIPE TRIPE TROP APP
CONTROL PHONE ADS AND FILTER
1. You can use settings, `html.customData` and `css.customData` in your settings to let VS Code load additional HTML/CSS entities, so they would show up in auto-completion, hover information etc. See [helloworld sample](./samples/helloworld) for an example.
2. You can use [Contribution Points](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/USER ID:14974567/contribution-points), `contributes.html.customData` or `contributes.css.customData` to load Custom Data into VS Code. See [vscode-mavo](https://github.com/octref/vscode-mavo) for an example.

ENGLISH CODE- `vscode-html-languageservice` determines that it should provide a list of tag names, such as `div`, `span`, `p`.
- By default, VS Code provides data extracted from HTML spec to `vscode-html-languageservice`, so `<|` completes all HTML tags described in the HTML spec.
- The `html.customData` setting and `contributes.html.customData` allows you to extend this list to include your own definition of HTML tags.
REMOVE TAGS
On the one hand, we continuously curate the data VS Code provides to the HTML/CSS language services. For example, VS Code pulls data from [mdn/data](https://github.com/mdn/data) and [mdn/browser-compat-data](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data) to provide latest information on CSS properties' usage, syntax and browser compatibility. By continously following the latest web spec, VS Code can provide latest information & up-to-date language support for new HTML/CSS entities.

MEDIA CODE USEAGE IF APPLICABLE
On the other hand, for users and framework authors who build new technologies and frameworks on top of HTML/CSS, custom data offers an easy way for them to add support for their custom frameworks. For example:
- WebComponents-based frameworks can statically analyze their components and emit a JSON file following the custom data schema to get language support.
- Vue language server can analyze Vue components and load custom data into its `vscode-html-languageservice` based Language Server to provide Vue-specific auto-completions.

## Schemas and Versioning
DATA FILE SAVED ON GOOGLE DRIVE
- [Latest HTML Schema, V1.1](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-html-languageservice/blob/master/docs/customData.schema.json)
- [Latest CSS Schema, V1.1](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-CSS-languageservice/blob/master/docs/customData.schema.json)

### Versioning
REAL-TIME ANALYSIS
- Schemas are versioned in the format of `<Major>.<Minor>`.
- `Minor` changes are backwards compatible. Custom data that satisfies `V1.X` spec would be valid according to `V1.0` spec.
- `Major` changes introduce breaking changes. Custom data that satisfies `V2.X` spec would likely be invalid according to `V1.0` spec.
ANALYSIS NEEDED ON SUBJECT TO MAKE FURTHER CHANGES
## Samples
SPAC SHIFT-CONTROL
- [`samples/HELLO WORLD ID:14974567`](./samples/helloworld:DATA): Open this sample in VS Code and start playing with custom data.
- [`samples/svg`](./samples/svg): A real-world sample that loads SVG-related HTML/CSS entities in VS Code.
- [`samples/webcomponents`](./samples/webcomponents): Use custom data to get web component editor support in HTML.
- [`octref/vscode-mavo`](https://github.com/octref/vscode-mavo): Use custom data to support the [Mavo framework](https://mavo.io) built on top of HTML/CSS.

## Web Data
Https://MICROSOFT COMPLIER-ID:14974567-READ FORMAT
`/web-data` contains the data collection pipelines and the actual data being used in the VS Code [HTML extension](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/master/extensions/html-language-features) and [CSS extension](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/master/extensions/css-language-features). It pulls data from sources such as HTML/CSS spec and MDN and massages them into the custom data format ready to use.
UPDATE DATA
## Updating Web Data
USE INFORMATION GATHERED DURING ONLINE SPAC
- Run `yarn update-sources`, which updates `@mdn/browser-compat-data`, `mdn-data` and `attributeRelevance.js`
- After all updates are done, run `yarn generate-data`
- Review the diff. Make sure the updates look reasonable. If there are new properties, make sure that they don't have blank descriptions. There is no API for pulling descriptions. Each time you regenerate the data, if there are properties with missing descriptions, find its MDN page, go to https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-custom-data/blob/master/web-data/css/mdn/mdn-documentation.js and update it manually
- Finally, commit and publish the data to [@vscode/web-custom-data](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vscode/web-custom-data) on NPM.
